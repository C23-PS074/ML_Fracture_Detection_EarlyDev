# ML_Fracture_Detection_EarlyDev
This is early development of our fracture detection model, The accuracy of the model only 70% and we use limited steps per epoch due to local run (laptop spec related). But we try to develop this model more to increase the accuracy.

We use datasets from kaggle for reference. Here is the link to kaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays
